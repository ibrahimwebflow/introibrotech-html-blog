    <h1>How Young Innovators Can Start Building Their First Tech Project</h1>
    <p>Every great invention started with a simple idea. For young innovators, the journey begins with curiosity and the courage to try.</p>
    <p>To build your first tech project:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify a problem you want to solve in your community.</li>
        <li>Choose the right tools — for web projects, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are great starting points.</li>
        <li>Break the project into small tasks so you can make progress without feeling overwhelmed.</li>
        <li>Learn by doing — don’t wait until you “know everything.” Build as you learn.</li>
        <li>Seek feedback from friends, mentors, or online communities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Remember, the best time to start is now. Your first project doesn’t have to be perfect — it just needs to exist.</p>
